# Accessibility statement for Matrix Block Anchor

Matrix Block Anchor is a plugin for Craft CMS 5. This statement sets out how accessible it is, what I know is wrong with it, and how to tell me about anything else.

## What this covers

This statement covers Matrix Block Anchor 3.4.0:

- the Matrix Block Anchor field, including its copy button
- the plugin settings page

It doesn't cover:

- Craft's own control panel, which Craft reports on at https://craftcms.com/accessibility
- your site's own templates and content

## The standard I'm working to

WCAG 2.2 level AA. Matrix Block Anchor adds to the Craft control panel, which is an authoring tool, so I also follow ATAG 2.0 Part A where it applies to the parts Matrix Block Anchor adds. Craft itself works to the same standards and publishes its own reports at https://craftcms.com/accessibility, but those reports don't cover plugins.

## How far it meets it

I believe it meets WCAG 2.2 AA, and the review found no issues. It hasn't been tested with assistive technology yet, though, so I'm not claiming full conformance until it has.

## How it was checked

Last checked in September 2026:

- A review of every control panel template, script and stylesheet against WCAG 2.2 AA, including the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices for any custom widgets, and contrast ratios worked out from the actual colours in the CSS.
- Not done yet: testing with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS and VoiceOver), zoom and reflow at 400%, or speech input. This statement will be updated once that's done.

## Known issues

None known right now. If you come across one, please tell me (see below).

## Tell me about a problem

If something in Matrix Block Anchor is hard or impossible for you to use, open an issue at https://github.com/john-henry/matrix-block-anchor/issues and put "Accessibility" in the title. Say which screen you were on, what you were trying to do, and which browser and assistive technology you use, if any. I aim to reply within five working days.
